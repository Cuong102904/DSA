/*The Tower of Hanoi, consists of three towers (a), (b), (c) together with ndisks of different sizes.
 Initially these disks are stacked on the tower (a) in an ascending order, i.e. the smaller one sits over the larger one.
 The objective of the game is to move all the disks from tower (a) to tower (c), following 3 rules:
 •Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 •Only the top disk can be moved
 •No large disk can be sit over a smaller disk.
 Let hndenote the minimum number of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with ndisks.
 What is the recurrence relation for hn?  */
